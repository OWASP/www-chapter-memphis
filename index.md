Welcome to OWASP Memphis!! What is OWASP Memphis? Well... we don't really know yet! I'm assuming you already know what OWASP is if you've gotten here; several local infosec professionals decided we need to be proactive in organizing so we started [MEMSEC](https://memsec.info), which has included DC901 and Memphis2600, and so we figured we should include OWASP as well. 

We have been meeting every first Friday of the month at the University of Memphis in the [FedEx Institute of Technology (FIT)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=365+Innovation+Dr%2C+Memphis%2C+TN+38152) building, room 225

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/), and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/). We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
