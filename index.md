Accordingly, starting in 2020—**OWASP Memphis** will be covering a wide range of application security topics; and cater to beginners and advanced members alike. Our upcoming presentations will be designed for people in the technology industry: Developers, DevOps engineers, testers, security advisors, penetration testers and application security enthusiasts. Our future events will be aimed at providing relevant, practical and actionable knowledge, that translates to stronger security and robust software.
